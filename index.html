      <h1>Harvard CS50 Study Group</h1>

      <p>Hey all,</p>
      <p>We had a few people interested in the CS50 (CS is Computer Science, BTW) study group and Matt (not me, other Matt) volunteered to be a mentor when he's around, which is awesome because he's very knowledgeable.</p>
      <p>The CS50 course is an 11 week, free course available online through Harvard. It's wildly popular and takes a look at a lot of things that "Programming 101" courses tend to overlook. If I'm correct, it provides an overview of many essential technologies: C, SQL, HTML/CSS, Python, and JavaScript. More importantly is looks like it will cover CS fundamentals such as memory management, data structures, algorithms, machine learning, etc. Important stuff that many programming programs gloss over. <strong>However, I don't believe any programming experience is necessary; it's mostly CS theory.</strong></p>
      <p>Matt and I were discussing a format that we think would work well with Mentorship Saturdays: working through the weekly lessons and assignments independently then going over the concepts and asking questions Saturday mornings. This could be supplemented with questions during the week on Slack (if you're not on the Metorship Saturday Slack channel, join today: ask Me or The Dark Lord or Chris or Brad for an invite).</p>
      <p>Since it's self-paced people can jump in and out whenever is convenient. Just come with questions! We're going to start November 5th with Week 0: Scratch. Both Matt and I should be at Metal Toad.</p>
