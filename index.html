      <h1>Harvard CS50 Study Group</h1>

      <p>Hey all,</p>
      <p>We had a lot of people interested in the CS50 (CS is Computer Science, BTW) study group and Matt (not me, other Matt) volunteered to be a mentor when he's around, which is awesome because he's very knowledgeable.</p>
      <p>The CS50 course is an 11 week, free course available online through Harvard. It's wildly popular and takes a look at a lot of things that "Programming 101" courses tend to overlook. If I'm correct, it provides an overview of many essential technologies: C, SQL, HTML/CSS, Python, and JavaScript. More importantly it looks like it will cover CS fundamentals such as memory management, data structures, algorithms, machine learning, etc. Important stuff that many programming programs gloss over. <strong>However, I don't believe any programming experience is necessary; it's mostly CS theory.</strong></p>
      <p>Matt and I were discussing a format that we think would work well with Mentorship Saturdays: working through the weekly lessons and assignments independently then going over the concepts and asking questions Saturday mornings. This can be supplemented with questions during the week on Mentorship Saturday's Slack (ask Me or Matt for an invite); our channel is <strong>#cs50</strong>.</p>
      <p>Since it's self-paced people can jump in and out whenever is convenient. Just come with questions!</p>
